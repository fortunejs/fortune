# To-do list

- Router abstraction from HTTP, consolidate `request` and `response` in the `context` object.
- Add serializer hooks to allow the entire request/response payload to be transformed (useful for "meta" object).
- Pagination.

### Done

- Remove `require` calls in Serializer and Adapter. (resolved by removing strings)
- Nothing
