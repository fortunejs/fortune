  - The `fortune.net` namespace is removed. For example, use `require('fortune-http')` instead of `fortune.net.http`.
  - The IndexedDB adapter must be specified manually via `require('fortune-indexeddb')`, it is no longer default for the browser.
- Remove feature: it is no longer possible to *ponyfill* `Promise` by assigning to the main export.

### 4.2.5 (2016-09-22)
- Fix: update IDs for which records could not be found should throw an error.


### 4.2.4 (2016-09-19)
- Polish: drop Bluebird as default Promise implementation, defer to built-in Promise or use user-supplied Promise.


### 4.2.3 (2016-09-13)
- Polish: do not sort object fields by default, it just doesn't make sense.

- Minor bugfix: do not mutate update object in the request payload.


### 1.0.2 (2015-08-17)
- Improvement: default priority of adapters in browser build: IndexedDB -> WebStorage -> memory adapter.


### 1.0.1 (2015-08-17)
- Fix: improve error handling for edge cases, so that they are not swallowed.
- Polish: drop `babel-eslint`.


### 1.0.0 (2015-08-15)
- Initial release of major version.


### 1.0.0-rc.14 (2015-08-15)
- Implemented memory adapter, which replaces NeDB as the default adapter.
- **Breaking change**: removed NeDB adapter, now belongs to a separate module: `fortune-nedb`.
- **Breaking change**: browser build now defaults to memory adapter.


### 1.0.0-rc.13 (2015-08-15)
- **Breaking change**: remove Micro API and JSON API serializers from this package, they are now external modules: `fortune-micro-api` and `fortune-json-api`.


### 1.0.0-rc.12 (2015-08-15)
- Harden serializer error handling, now rendered errors will never leak native errors, but `catch` handler will always receive the actual error.
- Implemented ad-hoc JSON-over-HTTP serializer, intended to be the new included default serializer.


### 1.0.0-rc.10 (2015-08-13)
- Allow `delete` method even if IDs are unspecified. A `delete` request with IDs unspecified will not return any records, but will emit a change event indicating the type deleted with a null value.


### 1.0.0-rc.7 (2015-08-11)
- Fix: URI decoding bug when encoded characters are part of the path, not just the query. Thanks [@unindented](https://github.com/unindented) for reporting!


### 1.0.0-rc.6 (2015-08-07)
- Prevent document replacement in NeDB adapter if no updates are specified.


### 1.0.0-rc.4 (2015-08-06)
- Fix: `change` event for created record shows ID instead of `undefined`. Thanks [@unindented](https://github.com/unindented) for reporting!
- Polish: do not send `Content-Type` header for `204` responses.


### 1.0.0-rc.3 (2015-08-03)
- Fix: when an update is modified in an input transform function, let the serializer know that the update has been modified and return the appropriate response.


### 1.0.0-rc.2 (2015-08-03)
- **Breaking change**: `transformInput` may accept 3 arguments for an `update` method, the last argument being the update itself, mutating the record has no effect.
- **Breaking change**: all integrity checking is done after input transform.
- Fix: asynchronous input transform for `delete` method.


### 1.0.0-rc.1 (2015-08-02)

### 1.0.0-beta.30 (2015-07-22)
- Fix page limit option in JSON API serializer.
- Change implementation of limit in serializers so that arbitrary max limit cannot be specified.
- Rename options `pageLimit` to `maxLimit`, and `includeDepth` to `includeLimit`.


### 1.0.0-beta.29 (2015-07-21)

- Moved JSON stringification out of serializers.
- Added `options` optional parameter for `http` function.


### 1.0.0-beta.20 (2015-07-13)
- Renamed `dispatch` to `request`. Internally the function is still `dispatch`, but the public API method name is changed, because it is more familiar terminology.
- Moved `methods` and `change` to static properties of top-level export.
- Drop arbitrary fields after running input transform.
- Map HTTP request headers to request `meta` object.


### 1.0.0-beta.16 (2015-07-12)

### 1.0.0-beta.14 (2015-07-08)

### 1.0.0-beta.6 (2015-07-02)

- Fix packaging of browser build, now it relies on the `browser` field.
- Update location of adapter test.
- Fix cross-browser compatibility issues with IndexedDB adapter.


### 1.0.0-beta.1 (2015-06-29)
- Changed sort value from a number to a boolean.

- Implemented IndexedDB adapter for browser build.


### 1.0.0-alpha.12 (2015-06-19)
- Change how `inflectType` option works for JSON API serializer. Now it inflects types everywhere, not just the URI.
- Rename `inflectType` to `inflectPath` in the Micro API serializer to reflect this difference.
- Include a core build, acccessible as `import 'fortune/core'`. This compact build is targeted for web browsers.


### 1.0.0-alpha.10 (2015-06-15)
- Throw a BadRequestError by default if input is wrong.
- Do not rely on `[Symbol] in ...`, it's incorrect implementation in ES6.
- The http module resolves to `context.response` on success.


### 1.0.0-alpha.9 (2015-06-05)
- Disallow related record creation route for Micro API. The complexity is not worth it.
- Make default `Allow` header response configurable.


### 1.0.0-alpha.8 (2015-06-04)
- Internal refactor: `Serializer` base class no longer implements anything, implementation moved to `DefaultSerializer` class.
- Fix link ID enforcement, add tests.
- Fix `Content-Length` header value for unicode string payloads.
- Restrict deleting and patching a collection for JSON API, restrict creating with ID in route for Micro API.
- Show `Allow` header when method is unsupported or `OPTIONS` request is sent.
- For JSON API and Micro API, serializer input must match the output.


### 1.0.0-alpha.7 (2015-06-03)
- Renamed `schemas` -> `recordTypes`, and `schema` -> `field`. "Schema" was incorrect terminology to use in the first place, record type is much more restrictive.
